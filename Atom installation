Already it looks usable and is inrteresting because its design is based on the WWW browser Chromium rather than a text editor base.
It looks usable and has Git and Python support to some extent, which might prove useful, though it is to early for me to say how.
So far all I can say is that it is an impressive package but I don't yet know how to use it with Git (or very likely I would be using it here now.
