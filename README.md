# Initiation
Getting familiar with Git and selecting tools for when we get down to business.

I hope this is the readme, or it will be a regret instead instead.
The intention is that we might as well use the process of getting familiar with the tools, as a sample with which we can explore how to cooperate within Git. 
After all, nothing about Git suggests that it is limited to system production, and production processes must include similar communication and investigation stages as well.
I'll start by writing an introduction section. You folks can join in, either forking or editing and raising issues.
