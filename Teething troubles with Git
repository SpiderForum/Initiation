It isn't clear to me what I am doing here. 
I tried to create a branch to deal with Git alone, but as far as I can see I am dealing with the old master branch.
I am continuing to see whether I wind up with two functional distinct branches, which is the intention.
OK I suppose, that looks as though it worked and I now have a separate teething troubles branch inside (*I hope*) repository Initiation.
