It isn't clear to me what I am doing here. 
I tried to create a branch to deal with Git alone, but as far as I can see I am dealing with the old master branch.
(OK, the indications were misleading; when I changed the text, the old branch was unaffected.)
I am continuing to see whether I wind up with two functional distinct branches, which is the intention.
OK I suppose, that looks as though it worked and I now have a separate teething troubles branch inside (*I hope*) repository Initiation.
For me, moving around still is cumbersome. I got here  by going right back to the SpiderForum organisation and then back down. But as I write this I still haven't managed to get out of this plain edit mode.
I have however found editing instructions at [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
and how to wrap the lines (click on the top right pull-down button in this editing window and select soft-wrap).

The markups include **bold** and *italic* and presumably ***both*** (I bet you can break lines too with br inside angle-brackets)
You can add URLs inside single square brackets.
Still can't find the updated "readable" text, only edit mode after committing.

##Branching in the GitHub interface

To create a new branch, you can go to the [main project page](https://github.com/SpiderForum/Initiation) and click on the button that says "Branch: master" and type the name of the new branch.

With that said, you really shouldn't be doing much of your work online through the web interface. Did you already [download git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) onto your local machine, and clone this project?
